## Introduction

For this assignment, an employer would like to view my deployed portfolio of work samples in order to review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position.  An effective portfolio featuring deployed web applications can highlight various skills and is a key requirement in the interview process.

## Criteria
To meet the accepted criteria of this assignment, I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS files that feature the following:

A portfolio featuring my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

Links in the navigation that when clicked on, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

A link in the the section about my work that when clicked on, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my application.

My first application's image is present.

A link of the application that when clicked on, sends the user to that deployed application.

When the page is resized or someone views the site on various screens and devices, the user is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.

## References
To complete this assignment I first my cloned my final HTML and CSS files/completed Assignment from Assignment 1 as the starter code, but in order to best meet the Acceptance Criteria of this assignment, I realized that wasn't the best solution.  Then I cloned the HTML and CSS files from "Activity 22-Stu_Mini_Project" from the Module 1 HTML Class File as the starter code since that activity was a beginner portfolio type of website.

However, much of the Acceptance Criteria for Assignment 2 wasn't on that activity, so ultimately I used the following activities from the Module 2 Advanced CSS Class File as references for this Assignment:

"01-Ins_Media_Query_Screen"
"05-Ins_Responsive_Design"
"06-Stu_Responsive_Design"

The process of coding for me involved using code from these activities and commenting out every section of code on the HTML and CSS pages to see what that specific block of code accomplished.  This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed from an HTML and CSS coding prespective to ultimately complete the Acceptance Criteria of the assignment.
